- 👋 Hi, I’m @ZacharyPataky!  I started my programming journey at Canisius College where I grew to both love and so deliciously hate computers.  It took four years of hard labor, but I graduated in 2022 with the confidence, skills, and gusto to tackle our great industry.  I'm currently a Junior Software Engineer at CYBRA Corporation where I develop our premier _MarkMagic_ product line.  You know those bar codes you see littered all over your packages?  Yeah, they were probably printed with my company's software.  Nowadays, much of my work aligns with full-stack development, including Angular, Spring Boot, and a plethora of other goodies.

- 👀 I find myself most interested in the arts.  Do you know what it feels like to be so gripped by a story or action that you can't peel your eyes away from it?  I crave that feeling.  I often find it digesting films, literature, music, video games, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.  I'm also an immense advocate of continual learning.  If I'm not cozied up soaking up a story, you can find me watching a YouTube video or Udemy course on tech-related topics.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Angular.  Most of these efforts are for work (I was hired to be a Java developer... I became full-stack three weeks in...); however, I'd also like to learn how to build nifty websites for my own pursuits.  I already have some concepts in mind for a personal website, which you guys may see grow here.  Alongside web development, I'm also super interested in learning about introductory game development and ethical hacking.  So many directions, so many epic opportunities.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a game development project.  My favorite course-related memory during my Computer Science degree was when I worked on a semester-long game with a small team.  I've never felt prouder of myself, nor so masterful of my skills than that moment.  Well, my friends, I'd like to up the ante.  Let me know if you're interested in making a kick-ass game.

- 📫 How to reach me: People have tried various methods over the years... telegram, carrier pigeon, smoke signal, etc.  My preferred route is email.  You can find me at _zacharypataky@gmail.com_.  Please attach a joke somewhere in your email - it'll make my day.
