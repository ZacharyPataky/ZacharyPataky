Hello there,

My name is Zachary Pataky, and I'm a software engineer.  I graduated with a Computer Science BS from Canisius College in 2022, where my education equipped me with the necessary skills and gusto to thrive in our software industry. While I'm happy to tackle any topic, my work experience has culminated in a specialization in full-stack web development.

I'm an enormous advocate for the arts; I believe they're the crux binding our hearts and souls together.  In my free time, I enjoy digesting films, literature, music, video games, and even Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.  I'm also a firm believer in lifelong learning, and regularly engage in Udemy courses or YouTube videos to broaden my knowledge of tech-related topics.

I'm currently focusing on refining my Angular and .NET skills, both for professional and personal development.  I have a few ideas in mind regarding sandbox websites, which you guys can observe me develop here.  Alongside web development, I'm also interested in honing my data management skills with introductory game development.

People have tried various methods of contacting me over the years... telegram, carrier pigeon, smoke signal, etc.  My preferred approach is email.  You can find me at _zacharypataky@gmail.com_.  Oh, and please don't forget to embed a joke somewhere in your message - it'll make my day!

Yours truly,

Zachary A. Pataky


<!-- - ðŸ‘‹ Greetings, my name is Zachary Pataky.  I graduated with a Computer Science BS at the esteemed Canisius College.  I now hate computers more than I love them, but I'm confident enough to admit that my education instilled the proper skills and gusto to tackle the software industry.  I'm currently a Junior Software Engineer at CYBRA Corporation, where my team develops our premier _MarkMagic_ product line.  My team is responsible for writing the programs that illustrate and print the barcodes on your packages.  Nowadays, much of my work aligns with full-stack development, focusing on Angular, Spring Boot, and a plethora of other digital goodies.

- ðŸ‘€ I'm a person most interested in the arts.  It doesn't matter if I'm reading an essay, gazing at a film frame, or soaking in the words of an old man; art is a meaningful.  It's how we, as humans, communicate our souls with one another.  Without it, where would we be?  In my spare time, you can find me digesting films, literature, music, video games, and even Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (yes, that's most certainly an art).  I'm also an advocate of continual learning, so don't be surprised if you find me watching YouTube videos or completing Udemy courses on personal/work-related topics.

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently focusing on refining my Angular skills.  Most of these efforts are dedicated to work (I was hired to be a Java developer... I became a full-stack developer three weeks in...); however, I'm also interested in improving for my personal pursuits.  I already have concepts in mind for a personal website, which you guys may see develop here.  Alongside web development, I also wish to hone my data management skills with introductory game development.  So many directions, so many epic opportunities.

- ðŸ“« You want to contact me, eh?  People have tried various methods over the years... telegram, carrier pigeon, smoke signal, etc.  My preferred route is email.  You can find me at _zacharypataky@gmail.com_.  Please attach a joke somewhere in your email - it'll make my day. -->
