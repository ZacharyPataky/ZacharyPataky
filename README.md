- 👋 Hi, I’m @ZacharyPataky!  I started my programming journey at Canisius College where I grew to both love and so deliciously hate computers.  It took four years of hard labor, but I graduated in 2022 with the confidence, skills, and gusto to tackle our great industry.  I'm currently a Junior Software Engineer at CYBRA Corporation where I develop our premier _MarkMagic_ product line.  You know those bar codes littering our many packages?  Yeah, they were probably printed with my company's software.  Nowadays, much of my work aligns with full-stack development, including Angular, Spring Boot, and a plethora of other digital goodies.

- 👀 I find myself most interested in the arts.  It doesn't matter if what I'm encountering is an essay, a film frame, or the coarse words from an old man; art is meaningful.  It's the way we as humans communicate our souls with one another.  Without it, where would we be?  I often find myself digesting films, literature, music, video games, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.  I'm also an immense advocate of continual learning.  If I'm not cozied up soaking in a story, you can likely find me watching a YouTube video or Udemy course on tech-related topics.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Angular.  Most of these efforts are for work (I was hired to be a Java developer... I became full-stack three weeks in...); however, I'd also like to learn how to build nifty websites for my own pursuits.  I already have some concepts in mind for a personal website, which you guys may see grow here.  Alongside web development, I'm also super interested in learning about introductory game development and ethical hacking.  So many directions, so many epic opportunities.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a game development project.  The greatest project I ever worked on during my undergraduate studies was a semester-long game with a small team.  I've never felt prouder of myself, nor so masterful of my skills than the moment I delivered its final presentation.  Well, my friends, I'd like to up the ante.  Let me know if you're interested in making a kick-ass game.

- 📫 How to reach me: People have tried various methods over the years... telegram, carrier pigeon, smoke signal, etc.  My preferred route is email.  You can find me at _zacharypataky@gmail.com_.  Please attach a joke somewhere in your email - it'll make my day.
