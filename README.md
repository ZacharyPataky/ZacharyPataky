- 👋 Hi, I’m @ZacharyPataky!  I'm a Computer Science graduate of Canisius College's class of 2022.  I'm currently a Junior Software Engineer at CYBRA Corporation where I develop our premier _MarkMagic_ product line.  Much of my work is described as full-stack development.
- 👀 I’m interested in all kinds of things - particularly the arts.  I love digesting films, literature, music, video games, and BJJ.  I also enjoy learning, often finding myself treading through a YouTube or Udemy course on a tech-related topic.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a few things.  For starters, I'm trying to beef up my Web Development and Angular game.  Most of these efforts hinge on necessity for work; however, I'd also like to know how to build nifty websites for my own pursuits.  I already have a cool one in mind that you guys may see here soon.  After those, I'd like to pursue more courses in introductory game development and ethical hacking.  so many directions, so many cool opportunities. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a game development project.  I won't reach this phase in a while (my Web Development courses are long), but I'd love to reach out to a similar mind when I'm eventually ready to develop a small game.
- 📫 How to reach me: People have tried various methods over the years... telegram, carrier pigeon, smoke signal, etc.  My preferred route is email.  You can find me at _zacharypataky@gmail.com_.  Please attach a joke somewhere in your email - it'll make my day.
